## 📌 **Project Overview**  
This project explores the **linear kinematics** of a **squat** using **Kinovea software**. By manually tracking joint movements **frame by frame**, we analyzed **position, velocity, and acceleration**, extracting key biomechanical insights.  

## 🎯 **Objectives**  
- Utilize **Kinovea** to track joint movement in a squat.  
- Perform **manual frame-by-frame tracking** to enhance accuracy.  
- Extract and analyze **position, velocity, and acceleration** of key joints.  
- Minimize calculation errors using **reference points** for speed and acceleration.  
- Interpret results to understand **biomechanical principles**.  

## 🏋️ **Methodology**  
1. **Video Selection:** A publicly available squat video with a clear **side view** was chosen for analysis.  
2. **Marker Placement:** Kinovea was used to track key joints:  
   - **Knee (Lateral Epicondyle of Femur)** – Evaluates squat depth and knee motion.  
   - **Shoulder (Acromion Process)** – Assesses upper body stability.  
   - **Elbow (Lateral Epicondyle of Humerus)** – Acts as a proxy for trunk stability.  
3. **Manual Tracking:** Frame-by-frame corrections ensured **precise motion tracking**.  
4. **Data Analysis:** Position data was exported, and velocity/acceleration were calculated using **reference points** to reduce errors.  
5. **Results Visualization:** Graphs and tables were generated to interpret kinematic parameters.  

## 📊 **Results & Insights**  
- The **knee traveled less** compared to the shoulder and elbow, confirming a **limited vertical range of motion** during a squat.  
- **Stable trunk movement**, indicated by the elbow-pelvis angle, plays a crucial role in squat performance and injury prevention.  
- Motion analysis using **Kinovea** provides a cost-effective way to study kinematics without specialized hardware.
